# Project Structure and Technology
This is a Turborepo monorepo project with the following structure:
- Root project configuration
- apps/web: Web application
- packages/store: Shared store package

# Technology Stack
- Runtime/Package Manager: Bun (preferred over npm/yarn)
- Language: TypeScript for all code
- Formatting/Linting: Biome (not ESLint/Prettier)

# Key Principles
- Minimize external dependencies whenever possible
- Prefer internal packages over external ones
- Use TypeScript features fully (strict typing, interfaces, etc.)
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate

# Code Style
- Use named exports over default exports
- Use arrow functions for functional components
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use explicit 'type' or 'interface' declarations
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use async/await over Promises
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

# Package Management
- Use Bun for package management
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Prefer devDependencies for build/dev tools
- Use workspace references for internal packages

# Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Separate business logic from UI when possible

# Testing Approaches
- Write unit tests for utilities and helpers
- Test components in isolation

# File Organization
- Group related files together
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Use index.ts files for clean exports
